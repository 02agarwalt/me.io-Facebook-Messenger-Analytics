## Requirements

1. Install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) (Node Version Manager)

    You can do this by running the command:
    
    `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.5/install.sh | bash`
    
    Now verify installation by running:
    
    `command -v nvm`
    
    If you get `nvm: command not found` or see no feedback, restart terminal and run it again.
    
    The correct output should be `nvm`.
    
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) using nvm with the following command: `nvm install node`
