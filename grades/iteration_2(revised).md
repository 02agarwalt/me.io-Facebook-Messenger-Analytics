# Iteration 2 Evaluation - Group 1

**Evaluator: [Peykar, Jordan](mailto:jpeykar1@jhu.edu)**

### Features
* Updated features look good. mebot to non-stretch is a good move

### UI sketches
* Significantly better but graphs still have no meaning (axes labeled; This is your main feature so you should be explicit here with what you want to show). We should be able to understand the graphs from the ui sketches (-1 point)

### Endpoint and/or other interface documentation
* No JSON out (return JSON) (Revised) (-1 points)

### UML Class diagram
* Your UML is interesting... We are going to have to talk about this in class (Revised)
* Controller and service should not be objects in UML, User should be connected to their related data, your processors do not belong in the UML

### Architecture
* All good here, just note that react runs on each computers browser, everyone does not go to the same react server, all it does is serve the files to the browser (this is just nitpicky but you should understand how react works)

### Initial code
* No prototyping for frontend code (This is the main feature of your app!!! Do some d3 prototyping!) (-2 points)
* Endpoints defined but no actual code for background (-1 point)

#### Initial commit made
* Everyone made a commit

### Other General Remarks


**Grade: 95/100**
