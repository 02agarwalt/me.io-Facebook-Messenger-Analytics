# Iteration 3 Evaluation - Group 1

**Evaluator: [Peykar, Jordan](mailto:jpeykar1@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
* Frontend and backend both seem stood up. Speaking of which maybe don't use that as your test responses, you know what I mean.
* Your app works fine on Safari.
* Looks like your frontend is pretty much complete all that is needed is to wire the data to it.
* I see one statistic up and tested
* I would have liked to see some progress on your non-CRUD feature (meBot) (-1)

### Design check-in
* Everything looks fine here

### Code Quality
* Good file structure for the most part
* Class structure looks fine
* I'm worried about the structure of the front end. You should not have that many html files if you are using react. There should really only be one html file. Try looking at react router if you want multiple pages. (-3)

### Git usage
(Group members are all being good about regular commits, use of branches, pull requests, etc?  All members contributing well?)
- One group member only has 2 lines of code committed. If you are doing paired programming either note it or switch off so that everyone has commits.(Revised) (-0) (Github error)

#### Use of the GitHub issue tracker to manage bugs, features, etc.
* All good here

#### Codebase pushed to master on your team's GitHub repository for our inspection
* All good here

### Iteration submission and reporting

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
(Could we successfully build the project from the README alone?)
* All good here. Please put this in the README too.

#### Top-level file CHANGELOG.md present in your repo and describes progress in this iteration well
* All good here

#### Use of GitHub's project boards to keep track of your progress
* Used but not projecting far enough in the future. You should fill out the project board for iterations 5 and 6 as well as 3 and 4 (-2)

### Other Remarks
#### Things to fix from this iteration:
* Work on meBot
* Frontend structure
* All members committing
* Filled out project board

**Grade: 94/100**
