# Iteration 6 Evaluation - Group 1 Me.io Facebook analytics

### Presentation
(Was the presentation itself done well - was it well-organized, easy to understand, and convincing?)

Very good


#### App demo
(Did app work well?  Did any errors arise during the demo?  How did the demo'd implementation line up with features proposed?)

Very good job on refining the app to make it meaningful - showing only the top 10 users in pie, filtering out stop words, etc.  Your final product really shone!

#### UI quality based on the demo
(Was it well-designed? Was it usable?  Did it have glitches?)

Excellent use of advanced view libraries, overall excellent.

### Testing and Coverage
(Continue to write more tests for new features and keep high coverage?)

Fantastic code coverage and great test suite

### Build and Deployment and git usage
(Same as previous iterations)

Docker build is still great

### Non-CRUD feature
(How did it turn out?)

Good, lots of algorithms here.

### Iteration progress reporting
(Final CHANGELOG.md and project boards updated?)

Good here

### Evaluation of project difficulty
(in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion)

This project hits most of the goals you aimed for and had multiple non-CRUD features 

### Overall Remarks

Great job on actually closing the loop on the app - its a very polished app for what you set out to do.

**Grade: 97/100**
