## Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 1

**Evaluator: [Peykar, Jordan](mailto:jpeykar1@jhu.edu)**

### The project idea
The project idea is pretty cool and I don't know of any applications that do this.
I think the project is difficult enough. You should express the difficulty of some
of the data analysis to show that the data processing is not trivial.

### Features
The feature list looks fine, just note that this may not be enough for a 5 person group.
Try adding additional features or making one or two of your stretch goals regular goals.
After going over this in class it seems you have enough just flesh out the data
processing you will be doing.

### UI sketches
The marvelapp site is great but you don't go into enough detail on it. You should
show some dummy data instead of those boxes as well as show the page that comes up
when you click on the graph.
(-2 points)

### Use Cases
Use cases need to be added for actually viewing the data you are displaying and
how the user will interact with that data.
(-5 points)

### Architecture
We talked about switching to flask which I believe is the right move if you want
to use MongoDB. With the fixes we talked about in class, the rest of your architecture
should be fine.


### General Remarks
I would recommend that if you really want to split up by front and backend to
take one person off the frontend and put them on the backend. Look to flesh out
your features so we can see how much you will be doing. The bot seems a little
ambitious but would probably be doable considering the size of your group.
