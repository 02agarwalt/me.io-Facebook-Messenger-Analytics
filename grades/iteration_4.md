### Implementation progress
[25 points]
* You should probably have other graphs working by this stage since this is such a large part of your project. Also the current graph does not work properly, the drag to see more does not work. Good that you have actual data running now. (-5 points)

#### Code Quality
[10 points]
* No issues

### Testing
[20 points]
* Looks good, tests are easy to run

#### Test coverage
[10 points]
* 98%, solid

#### Travis
[5 points]
* Nothing to note

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
[5 points]
* Still works like a charm

### Deployment
[5 points]
* easy docker deployment will make deploying to AWS simple

### Advanced Git usage
[10 points]
* Still good here

### Iteration submission and reporting

#### CHANGELOG.md updated and project boards updated, filling in goals for iterations 5 and 6
[10 points]
* All good here as well

### Other Remarks


**Grade: 95/100**
